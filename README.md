# Auto-Arborist Dataset - Cleaned
This goal of this respository is to introduce a pipeline to clean the auto-arborist dataset, i.e., ----
The complete dataset can be downloaded from:
- Provide the URL for the cvpr paper + supplementary
- Describe this dataset and the problems to be solved, i.e., class imbalanced, long-tailed, few-shot learning etc.--> we have a nice picture before this?
- Provide the class distribution for several cities (curve). 

Disclaimer: ....

## Major Challenges 
- Raw images are uncropped, therefore very noisy.
- Prone to mislabeling --> why?
- Limited examples for certain classes --> why?
- Noisy meta data, i.e., targeting tree(s) within an image is (are) not well-indicated.
- Etc.
  
- Technical Challenges --> fine-grained problem, i.e., very large intra-class variation, very small inter-class variation 
  

## Proposed Pipeline and Insights

- Case I   : No Bounding Box
- Case II  : Boundary-Sided Bounding Boxes
- Case III : Minimal Alignment? 

## Further Analysis and Discussion
- Tables : Summarization of class distribution, before and after cleaning, etc. 

## Experimental Results & Comparison
- Backbones : ResNet (maybe), EfficientNet, ConvNext, RegNet
